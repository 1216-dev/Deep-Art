# Deep-Art
This project implements Deep Art, an advanced neural style transfer technique, utilizing Whitening and Coloring Transform (WCT) for real-time and high-quality artistic stylization of images. By leveraging deep learning techniques with TensorFlow and Keras, it allows users to apply the artistic style of one image to any content image,
